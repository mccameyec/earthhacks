## Inspiration
The health of the planet is a monumental problem on multiple levels. And with recent studies showing that there is only 12 years left to limit long term climate change effects, the problem is as urgent as ever. Individuals, communities, governments, and nations must all be committed if we want to keep the Earth we know and love. 

One really powerful tool towards saving the planet is corporate sustainability.
