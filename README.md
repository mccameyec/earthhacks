## Inspiration
The health of the planet is a monumental issue on multiple fronts. And with neoteric studies announcing that there may be only 12 years left to curb the long-term effects of climate change, the problem is as urgent as ever. With a mammoth of a dilemma breathing down the neck of individuals, communities, governments, and nations, all members must be committed if there is hope to keep our Earth we know and love. 

An integral component in the roadmap to saving the planet exists at the corporate level. Large companies can be terrifically influential with how they choose to promote their social and economic values. And as Peter Parker would say: "With great power comes great responsibility". That is, corporations have the capability, and consequentially the duty, of promoting green thinking, educating their employees, and incentivizing them to be environmental altruists. Doing so can literally help **save the world**, but if that's not enough to appeal to CEO's and shareholders, being eco-friendly has the potential to advance a company's reputation and provide competitive vantage. 

What this all boiled down to was this single run-on sentence: "How can corporations, without wasting time and resources, encourage environmentally friendly behaviors within their ranks; while also not making it an insufferable experience for employees, but maybe something they might even enjoy?" 

## What is CleanStreak
Our project promotes sustainable living through an easy-to-use, easy-to-implement point collection system. Employees attach a uniquely identifiable QR code to a reusable water bottle and receive points to their account when that QR code is scanned at a water-refilling station on campus. The number of points earned increases when the resusable water bottle is used habitually, fulfilled through the "streak" mechanism. This concept extends to other habits as well. Employees can also earn points by biking to work and scanning at the bicycle rack on campus, or carpooling and entering their driver's unique code.

Points can then be redeemed at local businesses for free goods and services, discounts, and the kitchen sink. Ideas for partnerships include Lyft, coffee vouchers, and while in the natural spirit, at local outdoor companies such as rock climbing gyms and whitewater rafting companies.

For better or for worse, a significant chunk of an individual's adult life is spent working. Habits at work easily transfer to habits at home. We designed CleanStreak around green habits in the workplace, in the hope that these habits won't just be a way to get free Lyft rides, but like coal ash ponds, they'll seep into other areas.

## How we built it
As simply, and inexpensively as possible. Low materials cost.

Simple scanner app to scan unique QR codes and reward points to different users, can be run on an old smartphone!

Simple user app to add items, manage them, check your stats, and spend your points.

## Challenges we ran into 
Limited time to develop app -- compensated with pretty storyboarding.
