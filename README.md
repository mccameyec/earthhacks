## Inspiration
The health of the planet is a monumental problem on multiple levels. And with recent studies showing that there is only 12 years left to limit long term climate change effects, the problem is as urgent as ever. Individuals, communities, governments, and nations must all be committed if we want to keep the Earth we know and love. 

One very important part of the roadmap to saving the planet exists at the corporate level. Large companies can be extremely influential through how they promote their social and economic values. And with their power they can help or harm the enviroment to a much higher degree than individuals alone.
